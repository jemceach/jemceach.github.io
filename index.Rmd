  <h1>About Me </h1>
  <h1 id="ABOUT">Broke<b>R</b> than bad code & trying to do something about it...</h1> 
  <p> 
  Hello there! My name is Juliann and I am recent Data Science graduate looking to further my professional career.  I am a skilled analyst with 5 cumulative years of data-driven experience and possess a strong background in acquiring, organizing, analyzing, interpreting and visualizing data.  
  </p>  
  <br>
  <p>I am actively pursuing exciting, challenging, and meaningful job opportunities to put my <em>predictive modeling</em> and <em>machine learning</em> skills to work. To keep my skills sharp in the meantime, I'm happy to be able share and develop my R & python knowledge here with you. </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  This site is still under construction, so please bear with me as I dust off my mark-up language coding skills. A lot has changed since MySpace!  Keep coming back for frequent updates and improvements (and cute pictures of my favorite rescue pup / full-time assistant: Peapod <i class="fa fa-paw"></i>). 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  <em>In the works:</em>  
  <ul>
  <li> Time series tutorial: filled with gg-hacking goodies! Nothing better than learning various TS methods, while simultaneously figuring out how to make the `forecast` package play (and look) nice with ggplots. </li>
  <li> Recommender system tutorial: content-based filtering meets shiny apps! This one will be worth the wait. Promise. </li>
  <li> Geo-spatial analysis tutorial: Map time! </li>
  <li> And, last (but not least): First blog plot! I was hoping this "About Me" section would count, but will probably use this opportunity to create `blogdown` tutorial down the road. </li>
